## About

You're a cat, and you're composing your grand masterpiece on the fencetop; avoid the police and perform as long as you can to get spare change. Use the money to buy better equipment and make more change from your performances.

## Setting

1 screen, people, dogs, and cats wander around. The objective is to stop and hold performances for monies until you get caught.

## To build

The project is a Flash Builder project -- open, compile, and run.
